      <h2>About Stray Cats</h2>
      <p>How do you identify a stray cat? Should you feed stray cats, or take them to a vet? What should you feed them? There's a lot of confusion when it comes to stray cats, so I'll try my best here to answer these questions.</p>
      <h3>Is it a Stray?</h3>
      <p>
        It's important to find out if the cat you just found is really a stray cat or someone's beloved pet. It's rarely possible to be 100% sure, but a good way to tell is by examining the cat's behavior. If the cat is purring, rubbing up to you and letting you pet it, it's a good indicator of the cat having had an owner at some point. You can check with people living nearby to see if they've lost their cat, or have it scanned for a microchip. If you can't find the cat's owner, you have a few options which I'll cover later on in this article.

      <h3>Should I Feed Stray Cats?</h3>
      <p>
        Whether or not to feed stray cats can be a polarizing topic. Some say that if you feed them, it will attract more cats and create a problem in the area. In my opinion, there's nothing wrong with feeding a hungry stray cat and it may keep them from preying on local wildlife. Also, whether or not stray cats are fed, they will still breed. However, it's best to make sure the cat is spayed/neutered along with being fed.

      <h3>How to Help Strays?</h3>
      <p>
        There are numerous ways to help stray cats! If you have the means, you can adopt them into your home; but make sure you take them to the vet first! Stray cats may also have a hard time adopting to their new life, so be ready to help them transition. <br>
        If you cannot adopt the stray cat, it's best to either TNR (trap-neuter-release) or find a home for it. TNR is a good way to help strays, because it keeps them from increasing the population. Finding a home for a stray cat may be difficult, but taking it to the vet first for treatment will help a lot. Another option is to send the cat to an animal shelter, but this isn't the best option because the cat may be euthanized if it isn't a no-kill shelter.
