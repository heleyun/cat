      <h2>Fun Facts About Cats!</h2>
      <p>As we all know, cats are very interesting creatures. Their strange and entertaining behaviors have captivated humans throughout history! Cats are also capable of many astounding feats. Here's some fun facts about cats that you might not have known!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cats can actually be trained! If you use treats as a reward, you can train your cat to do many things, like give you a high-five! Just make sure not to let your cat train you instead...</li>
        <li>Cats have a third eyelid! If you have a cat, you may have seen it when your cat is asleep or very sleepy. It is a light-colored layer of skin that retracts over the eye, and is believed to help protect the cat's eyes from damage. Be careful, though; a third eyelid that is always exposed may be a sign of health issues!</li>
        <li>Cats can spend up to half of their day grooming! Grooming can be comforting for a cat, and you will often see a cat groom themselves before falling asleep. It can also be a way for cats to socialize with other cats or even you; so when your cat starts licking you, take it as a sign of affection!</li>
        <li>When you hear a cat purring, you may think that it is happy. But purring can serve many different purposes! For instance, when a cat is hurt it may start purring, and it definitely would not be happy in that moment. Cats may purr as an instinct to heal themselves, as well as showing affection and contentment.</li>
        <li>Does your cat knead you like you're a loaf of bread? This is a way for cats to mark their territory, and may also be a way of showing affection! Cats will often knead soft blankets or other soft things as well. Just make sure you keep your cat's claws trimmed so their love doesn't hurt you too much!</li>
        <li>It's a common misconception that cats enjoy sweet foods. Cats actually cannot taste sweets at all, so don't feed your cat ice cream!</li>
        <li>As you may know if you own a cat, they can sleep for a very long time! Cats can sleep up to 16 hours in a day, and can spend around 2/3 of their lives asleep. Cats do dream; so when you see your cat twitching their paws or making strange noises in their sleep, you'll know that they're probably having a very exciting dream!</li>
        <li>Ever wonder why your cat wants to smell <i>everything?</i> Cats rely on their sense of smell most of all, and use smells to identify things! A good way to greet a cat is to reach out and let them smell you, so they can become familiar with your scent.</li>
        <li>Cats have very powerful kidneys! They are able to survive by drinking seawater.</li>
